Smart Scoring Card for Clue Game.

This is a simply toy project I created on my own. It is designed to showcase javascript, css, html, nodejs, and express skills. 
You can now play the game of Clue and use the smart UI to track your queries as well as your opponents' queries. 
The application calculates probabilites of opponents having certain cards, and through tracking of all the queries, will automatically
eliminate items (i.e. suspects, weapons, rooms) once the program has deduced they are not in the solution. 
The program will display the solution once it is determined. 
Try it with your friends or children and see if they can beat you!
